Hi there! 🤗

I'm your Wordcab Summarization assistant.
Post any number of files in this channel and I'll summarize them for you.

You can customize the summarization parameters by adding them to your message:
- `summary_length`: the length of the output summary.
    ↳ Can be a single number or a comma-separated list of numbers between 1 and 5.
- `summary_type`: the type of the output summary (more details on [Summary Types](https://docs.wordcab.com/docs/summary-types)).
    ↳ Can be `narrative`, `conversational` or `no_speaker`.
- `source_lang`: the language of the input text.
    ↳ Can be `en` (English), `fr` (French), `de` (German), `es` (Spanish), `it` (Italian), `nl` (Dutch) or `sv` (Swedish).
- `delete_job`: whether to delete the job and its associated files after the summarization process.
    ↳ Can be `True` or `False`.

To choose custom parameters, add them to your message as follows:

e.g.:
    `2,4`, or `1,3,5 no_speaker False`, or `2,3,5 fr`, or `conversational de False 2,3`

_Note that the order of the parameters doesn't matter._

I'll also let you know when your job is done. 🤖
I use emojis as reactions to help you keep track of your launched jobs:

*Status:*
- ❌: the job has encountered an error (see the message for more details)
- ⌛: the job is currently being processed
- ✅: the job is done

*Parameters:*
- 1️⃣ - 🔟: the number corresponds to the number of tasks that need to be completed before the job is done
- 🇺🇸 - 🇸🇪: the flag corresponds to the language chosen as the source language

When a job is done, the output summaries will be attached as a reply to your message.

You can download them by clicking on the `Download` button.

Once you're done with your summaries, you can delete the initial message and all the output summaries will be deleted as well.
