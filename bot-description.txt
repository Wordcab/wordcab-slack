Hi there! 🤗

I'm your Wordcab Summarization assistant.
Post any number of files in this channel and I'll summarize them for you.

If you already have the transcript ID of the file you want to summarize, you can avoid uploading
a file by sending a message with `transcript_id:xxxxxxxx` of the file you want to summarize.

You can customize the summarization parameters by adding them to your message:
- `summary_length`: the length of the output summary.
    ↳ Can be a single number or a comma-separated list of numbers between 1 and 5.
- `summary_type`: the type of the output summary (more details on [Summary Types](https://docs.wordcab.com/docs/summary-types)).
    ↳ Can be `brief`, `narrative`, `conversational` or `no_speaker`.
- `source_lang`: the language of the input text.
    ↳ Can be `en` (English), `fr` (French), `de` (German), `es` (Spanish), `it` (Italian), `nl` (Dutch), `pt` (Portuguese) or `sv` (Swedish). e.g. `source_lang:en`
- `target_lang`: the language of the output summary.
    ↳ The same as `source_lang`. If not specified, the output summary will be in the same language as the input text. e.g. `target_lang:fr`
- `context`: the chosen context features to add to the output summary.
    ↳ Can be one or more between these values: `issue`, `purpose`, `next_steps`, `discussion_points` and `keywords`. Separate them with a comma (`,`) if you want to use more than one. e.g. `context:issue,purpose,keywords`.
- `ephemeral`: whether the transcript and summaries should be deleted from Wordcab servers after the outputs are sent to Slack. By default it's `true` while uploading a file and `false` while using a transcript ID.
    ↳ Can be `true` or `false`. e.g. `ephemeral:true`

To choose custom parameters, add them to your message as follows:

e.g.:
    `2,4`, or `1,3,5 brief`, or `2,3,5 source_lang:pt`, or `2 source_lang:en target_lang:fr context:issue,purpose`

_Note that the order of the parameters doesn't matter._

I'll also let you know when your job is done. 🤖
I use emojis as reactions to help you keep track of your launched jobs:

*Status:*
- ❌: the job has encountered an error (see the message for more details)
- ⌛: the job is currently being processed
- ✅: the job is done

*Parameters:*
- 1️⃣ - 🔟: the number corresponds to the number of tasks that need to be completed before the job is done
- 🇺🇸 - 🇸🇪: the flag corresponds to the language chosen as the source language and the target language

When a job is done, the output summaries will be attached as a reply to your message.

You can download them by clicking on the `Download` button.

Once you're done with your summaries, you can delete the initial message and all the output summaries will be deleted as well.
